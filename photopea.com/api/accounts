	<h1>Accounts</h1>
	
	<p>Photopea allows you to log-in through a third-party service (Google, Facebook ...).
	Once you do it, Photopea can <b>identify you</b> and store your settings online (theme, language, colors, tool options).
	Then, settings can be synchronized across all devices, where you use Photopea.</p>
			
	<p>Photopea offers two types of accounts: <b>Free</b> and <b>Premium</b>. The Free account is available to anybody
	for free at Photopea.com. The Premium account lets you use Photopea without advertisement and may have other benefits.</p>
	
	<p>You can see prices and manage your account through the <b id="acc-window">Account Window</b> (click the Account button at the top).
	Here you can order the Premium account or see, how many days of Premium you have left. Logging in is necessary for having Premium accounts.
	The basic option is a Premium account for a single user.</p>
	
	<img src="//i.imgur.com/3q2kgUo.png" class="fullw" />
	
	<h2 id="teams">Teams</h2>
	
	<p>You can order a Premium account for the whole team of users. It has three main benefits:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Just a single person pays for the whole team (more comfortable)</li>
		<li>You can change team members at any time</li>
		<li>You can save money (less expensive per user)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Creating teams is very simple. There are no emails, registrations, synchronizations etc.
	All can be done inside the Account window. First, everybody has to log in (and see their email address).</p>
	
	<img src="//i.imgur.com/qPnNtCi.png" class="fullw" />
	<p>
	Now, scroll down to Team Settings. A team leader (the one who pays for the account) ticks <b>Start a team</b> and fills in email addresses of all members of a team.
	Other team members tick <b>Join a team</b> and fill in the email address of a team leader. Press "Save Team Settings" to save it.</p>
	
	<a href="//i.imgur.com/yQUwPXI.png" target="_blank"><img src="//i.imgur.com/yQUwPXI.png" style="width:60%" /></a>
	
	<p>To be a member of a team, you have to "choose a leader" and the leader has to "choose you" as one of members.
	The leader can add or remove members at any time, and the member can change the leader at any time.</p>
	
	
	
	<h2 id="distributors">Distributors</h2>
	
	<p>Photopea API allows you to have the editor at your own website (using the <code>iframe</code>), and configure it as you wish, <b>for free</b>. 
	But sometimes, you may want to hide advertisement, social media buttons, branding ... let's call it a <b>whitelabel mode</b>.</p>
	
	<p>We have a list of domains, for which Photopea runs in a whitelabel mode. The <b>Distributor account</b> allows you to add your domain into that list.</p>
	
	<p>Order a distributor account (through the <a href="#acc-window">Account Window</a>) for the expected 
	<b title="A view is one loading of Photopea in a frame. Each reloading of a page is a new view.">number of views per month</b>.
	<!--
	If you exceed that number, just order a higher version next time.
	If you exceed the number many times (and ignore our emails), your domain may be removed from a list (you will have a standard mode instead of whitelabel).
	--></p>
	
	<p>After you pay for the Distributor account, enter the name of your domain into the Account window and click "Save Domain Settings". 
	You can change your domain at any time.</p>	
	
	<img src="//i.imgur.com/h6MAEYu.png" style="width:60%" />
	
	
	<h2 id="self-hosted">Self-Hosted Version</h2>
	
	<p>Photopea consists of a HTML file, a CSS file and several JS files (around 2 MB in total). 
	Running it is very simple, there is no need for any server-side technologies (no PHP, no Node.js, no databases).</p>
	
	<p>We provide a <b>self-hosted package</b> with a complete editor, which you can use on your own server.
	It has several benefits over Distributor accounts:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>you can change CSS styles</li>
		<li>you can run it in a local network without internet access</li>
		<li>you do not depend on Photopea.com (when you are afraid, that it may go down)</li>
		<li>you can be sure, that no part of the editor changes while you run it</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>A self-Hosted version costs between $500 and $2000 per month. You should pay for a whole year (12 months) in advance, 
	and you will get resources, that will work for exactly one year. After each year, you can decide, if you want to pay for a next year
	(and get new resources), or terminate it. You can get two updates during a year for free (at any time), each next update costs $300.</p>
	
	<p>Write us an email to <a href="mailto:support@photopea.com">support@photopea.com</a> 
	and tell us an estimated number of your users (and the usage frequency), so we can discuss the terms of our agreement.</p>
